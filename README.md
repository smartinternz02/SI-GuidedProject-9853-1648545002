# Recipe Recognition With Deep Learning  &amp; IBM Watson
Food is an essential component of our individual and social life. Eating habits have a direct impact on our health and wellbeing, while Recipes, flavor and cooking recipes shape specific cuisines that are part of our personal and collective cultural identities. But there are also interesting applications of automatic food recognition to self-service restaurants and dining halls. For instance, accurate detection and segmentation of the different food items in a food tray can be used for monitoring food intake and nutritional information, and automatic billing to avoid the cashier bottleneck in self-service restaurants. This work deals with the problem of automated recognition of a photographed cooking dish and the subsequent output of the appropriate recipe.

This project consists of four folders
1. Dataset Folder <br />
    This folder contains images of the food items. For this project we have taken French Fries, Pizza and Samosa images for training and testing the model. 
>>  - Testing Set
>>  - Training Set
2. Flask <br />
>>  - Static
>>  - Templates
>>  - Uploads
>>  - app.py file
>>  - Recipe.hs Model file which contains the weights of the model
3. IBM files <br />
>>  - IBM Deployment model file.ipynb
>>  - Downloading model file from IBM watson studio.ipynb
>>  - IBM_flask file
>>  - IBM_scoring_point.ipynb
4. Model Building <br />
>>  - Recipe Recognition Model.ipynb
>>  - Testing the Recipe Recognition.ipynb
>>  - Recipe.h5 file which created from Recipe Recognition model
